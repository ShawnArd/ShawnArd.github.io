                        I am an aspiring full-stack web developer and a graduate of Northwestern's Full-Stack immersive program. I am currently working with <a class="text-link" href="https://www.thedifferenceengine.io/" target="_blank">The Difference Engine</a>, 
                        a Nonprofit Organization which builds websites for charities and other nonprofit groups. Iâ€™ve been utilizing React, Python, and Django to build out the front-end interfaces and back-end applications.

                        I have always been civic-minded with an affinity for technology. While studying at Penn State, I was the IT Director for the <a class="text-link" href="ccsgpsu.org" target="_blank">Council of Commonwealth Student Governments</a>. To best serve this role, 
                        I taught myself PHP, HTML, and CSS. I oversaw the transition between a fully PHP site and a more modern HTML, CSS, JS based design.

                <p>
                        After graduating from Penn State with a Bachelor of Science in Biological Engineering, I joined a research team with the University of Chicago as a Research Assistant. After two years of conducting research related to Pulmonary Fibrosis, 
                        I realized I needed to change careers to something I was more passionate about. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                        I decided to pursue programming again, and started with Codecademy. I quickly realized this is something I could see myself doing as my career. I continued with Codecademy Pro and Free Code Camp, while still working as a Research Assistant
                        at the University of Chicago. In September 2018 I decided to pursue my programming career full-time, left my Research Assistant role, and enrolled in the Northwestern Full-Stack Academy program.
